# CTemplate and Component Column for ExtJS

## Overview

This repository contains the releases for CTemplate and Component Column.

Originally developed in 2011, these allowed components to be rendered inside ExtJS grid cells. This was back when ExtJS was on version 4.0 and the built-in Widget Column didn't yet exist.

Version 1.2 should work against any version of ExtJS from 4.0 to 7.3 and hopefully beyond. It seems likely that there will be incompatibilities with some versions but none are known. Sencha limits access to its library, making compatibility testing difficult.

This project is in maintenance mode but you can still report any problems using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/skirtles-code/extjs-component-column/issues).
