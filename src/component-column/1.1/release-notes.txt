* Version 1.1, 07-May-2013:

- Minor fixes for compatibility with ExtJS 4.1 and 4.2.
- Fixed a bug that caused the scope of the renderer function to be incorrect. It should now be consistent with a normal column.
- Added component query support, such that injected components are treated as children of the column.
- Enhancements in CTemplate 1.1 allow components to be reused across multiple grid refreshes.
- Take the visibility of the column into account when resizing the child components.
- Child components remained visible when the column was hidden in IE 6 and 7.

* Version 1.0, 22-Sep-2011:

- First public release.
