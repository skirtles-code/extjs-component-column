* Version 1.1, 07-May-2013:

- Added an applyOut method for better compatibility with ExtJS 4.1. This method will be unavailable running against 4.0.
- Fixed a stack overflow seen against ExtJS 4.1.
- Added support for injecting components that have already been rendered.
- Don't perform substitution on $comp as that has special significance in a renderTpl.

- First public release.
